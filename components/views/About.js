<p>I just recently graduated from St. Louis Community College at Meramec and got my Certificate of Specialization in Computer Applications. I really enjoyed taking SavvyCoders, because I really like meeting everyone. All of the teachers have a good knowledge regarding what their talking about in the lessons, and some teachers are really funny. I also hired one of the TAs as my regular online tutor, which I really needed. I learned so much through my classmates. I usually pop in at 6:15pm, and when Joe pops in, we laugh and talk about life. Brian, who I actually met in person when I got my SavvyCoders T-shirt, encouraged me in my college classes, when I was really struggling. Now for Jason. He is opened and honest about his issues in organizing code. I wish I had the courage to ask questions in class like he does.</p>
